ComfyDash – Local Model Catalog Dashboard

ComfyDash helps you make sense of all your downloaded checkpoints, LoRAs, and embeddings by scanning your ComfyUI directories and presenting them in a clear, searchable dashboard. It’s a lightweight local catalog and management tool for ComfyUI model data.

Do you know the issue? You download checkpoints, LoRAs, and embeddings, use them for a while, and later wonder what they actually do. ComfyDash was created to solve exactly that — giving you a clear overview of everything stored in your local ComfyUI setup.

ComfyDash combines a Python‑based scanner that generates a structured catalog.json file with a modern React frontend built using Vite and TailwindCSS.

🚀 Features (MVP 1.0)

🧩 Scanner (Python CLI)

Scans any ComfyUI model directory (Checkpoints, LoRAs, Embeddings)

Generates a unified catalog.json file

Captures file size, modification date, type, and stable ID

Automatically skips missing or invalid files

🖥️ Dashboard (React + Tailwind)

Accordions per model type (Checkpoint / LoRA / Embedding)

Search & filter (client‑side, no backend required)

Inline editing for CivitAI title, link, trigger tags, base model, provenance, etc.

Local persistence of all edits via localStorage

Heuristic suitability detection (📷 Realistic / ✏️ Drawing)

Favorites system and provenance toggle (Auto / Manual)

Pagination (10 items per accordion)

Responsive layout with a “Fit to window / Limit width” toggle

Sticky header and sticky first column for improved readability

🧰 Installation

Requirements

Node.js ≥ 18.x (includes npm)

Python 3.12+

🪟 Quick Start (Windows)

ComfyDash can now be launched with a single double‑click.

1️⃣ Clone and setup

git clone https://github.com/max-dingsda/ComfyDash
cd ComfyDash
cd comfydash
npm install

2️⃣ Start ComfyDash

Run the PowerShell script in the project root:

start_comfydash.ps1

This will:

start the local Python API (mini_server.py)

start the Vite dev server (npm run dev)

open your browser at http://localhost:5173

💡 Alternative: run start_comfydash.bat for an even quicker double‑click start.

🧪 Usage

Open the dashboard in your browser.

Click “Open catalog.json” or “Fetch” to load a generated file.

Use Search, Filters, and Accordions to explore your models.

All edits (titles, tags, links) are stored locally in your browser.

Running the scanner manually

python main.py --root "<path_to_your_ComfyUI_folder>" --output "<your_ComfyDash_path>/catalog.json"

Mini API (for integration)

The local API mini_server.py allows the dashboard to run the scanner directly:

python mini_server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

Endpoints:

GET /health → { ok: true }

POST /scan → { root: "F:\\AI\\ComfyUI", output: "optional\\catalog.json" }
